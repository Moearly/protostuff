#summary Existing pojos or ejbs can be protobuf encoded/serialized.
#labels Featured

The *protostuff-runtime* module takes advantage of the speed and efficiency of protobuf serialization, while at the same time allowing your pojos to be written to different formats (json, xml, etc).

The key factor is that protostuff does not need a message to implement/extend certain classes in order to be serialized.

What this module does is generate a schema at runtime where you can use it and cache it to write and read protobuf-encoded messages.

_Note that you can also hand-code schemas to avoid reflection._

{{{
   Foo foo = new Foo("foo", 1, 3.5);

   Schema<Foo> schema = RuntimeSchema.getSchema(Foo.class);
   
   //serialize
   byte[] data = IOUtil.toByteArray(foo , schema);

   //deserialize
   Foo f = new Foo();
   IOUtil.mergeFrom(data, f, schema);
